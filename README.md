Cricket fans always look for the fastest yet accurate match scores and updates. Each player can maintain their profiles. Tournament organizers can easily select top players without connecting to different selectors and organizers just by seeing the stats of players managed profile. National team selectors can then gather data from web page. Viewers are also entertained by watching live scoring and the predicted results. 

Considering the high demand of players in our country, talent recruiters need to search for players at very grass root level. As there are thousands of local cricketers, it’s very difficult for recruiters to cherry pick the special ones as they will require proper stats and regular day performances of the players . This App would just be the solution of this problem as it will record every single players performance ball by ball and will wire up all the data into a Players’ Profile with all the data available such as his/her Average , Strike Rate , Highest Score etc. . And this will not be only limited to players stats but this will help manage the records of different teams of towns/areas.

The solution is to make a platform where all the players’ stats, teams and tournaments data and future events are displayed and updated to help the talent recruiters find their players. The platform will display the players Average, Strike Rate, Highest Score etc., future tournaments of different areas, live scoring and predictions.
